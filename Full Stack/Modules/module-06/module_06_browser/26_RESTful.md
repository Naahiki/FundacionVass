# RESTful routing

## What is RESTful routing?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. The comunication system that is used in RESTful routing is called HTTP. HTTP is a protocol that is used to transfer data between a client and a server.

One of the isues with HTTP is that it's stateless. This means that when you navigate from one page to another page, HTTP doesn't retain any of the information between the pages. This means that developers need to implement code to let applications know how to act and what's going on.

Everything you do on the web can be boiled down to five tasks:

- POST - create a new resource
- GET - read a resource
- PUT - update a resource
- PATCH - update a resource, but not actually replacing it
- DELETE - delete a resource

REST is a convention that developers use to make HTTP requests. It's a way to make HTTP requests in a way that is easy to understand and easy to implement.
